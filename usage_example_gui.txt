Usage example using GUI:

- Create new class named Data.java
- In this class you have to declare which data will Cep server process. Modify it for your needs.
- In our demo we will process only double values from the sensor.

- Open Monitor.java file and add "static CepHttpServlet cepServer;"
- Add "cepServer = new CepHttpServlet(cseService, Data.class);"
- Add "cepServer.run();"
- Add "cepServer.stopThread();"
- Add "cepServer.insertDevice(sensorId);"
- Add "Data data= new Data(sensorValue);	cepServer.sendEvent(data, sensorId);"

- Right click on org.eclipse.om2m project -> Run as -> Maven install

- Open explorer and go to org.eclipse.om2m\org.eclipse.om2m.site.in-cse\target\products\in-cse\win32\win32\x86_64
- Double click on start.bat
- Type "ss" into comand line and look for id of your recently created plugin (e.g. org.eclipse.om2m.sample.ipe)
- Type "start id" (e.g. "start 32")

Add new cep rule:
- Open "http://localhost:8081/cep" and login (default values for login are also "admin" : "admin"). Here you can add/delete/update cep rules for specific device.
- Under Device name select "MY_SENSOR"
- Under Data name type "CEP_DATA"
- Under Rule type "select * from Data.win:length(2) having avg(value) > 50" (which means if OM2M recieves two sequential sensor measurments which average is bigger then 50, then cep rule is triggered)
- Click Create

Check your om2m platform:
- Open web browse and type into url "http://localhost:8080/webpage" and login (default values for login are "admin" : "admin"). Here you can monitor your data and data catched into predefined cep rules.
- Under MY_SENSOR -> DATA are all sensor measurments sent to OM2M platform
- Under MY_SENSOR -> CEP_DATA are all triggered messages by predefined cep rules
